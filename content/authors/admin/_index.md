I am a programming enthusiast pursuing computer engineering in my final year at Pune Institute of Computer Technology. My prime areas of focus are cybersecurity & deep learning. I am a FOSS guy, passionate primarily about Linux. You can find me hanging out on GitHub, contributing to awesome open-source projects. I write technical blogs on a variety of topics that interest me.
